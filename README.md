Those are the weapon skills.

#### What are decorations?

Those are the drifstone skills.

#### Couldnt you make it better?

No, i dont know programming so i butchered everything until it worked.

Delete "settings.cfg" within the installation folder and dont mess with the settings again.

Not at the moment, if you want to translate the files you can find them here:

You create a folder with the language name in "Athenas ASS - By Gatomiau\Data\Languages" and put the files in there, then you select "language -> new language you added" on the program.
